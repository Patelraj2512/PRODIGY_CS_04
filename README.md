# Keylogger Tool

## Overview
This is a simple keylogger application built in Python that can record keyboard inputs. The project was developed as Task 4 for Prodigy InfoTech internship and is intended for **educational purposes only**.

## Features
- **Keystroke Recording**: Captures all keyboard inputs until ESC key is pressed
- **Log Management**: Read, delete, and backup log files
- **Security**: Encrypt log files for added protection
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple menu-driven console interface

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keylogger-tool.git
   cd keylogger-tool
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pynput cryptography
   ```

## Usage

Run the application:
```
python task4.py
```

### Menu Options

1. **Start Keylogger**
   - Begins recording keystrokes
   - Press ESC key to stop recording

2. **Read Log File**
   - Displays the contents of the keylog.txt file

3. **Delete Log File**
   - Removes the keylog.txt file

4. **Backup Log File**
   - Creates a backup copy named backup_keylog.txt

5. **Encrypt Log File**
   - Encrypts the log file using Fernet encryption
   - Provides a key for later decryption

6. **Exit**
   - Closes the application

## Example

```
